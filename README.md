# Kubeit 🏗️🚀

Kubeit is a service-team-focused tool designed to simplify Kubernetes deployment configuration. Service teams can write a minimal YAML file describing their application or infrastructure, and Kubeit automatically transforms it into fully rendered Kubernetes objects that can be seamlessly included with the deployed container.

Why Choose Kubeit?

- Declarative & Simple – Define your infrastructure in a straightforward YAML format, reducing complexity.

- Flexible & Extensible – Supports Helm, CRDs, and custom templates, adapting to various use cases.

- Service-Team Friendly – Designed for service teams to manage deployments efficiently without needing to manually write Kubernetes manifests or complex Helm charts.

- Seamless Integration – Easily integrates into CI/CD pipelines and development workflows for smooth deployments.

- Deployment Configuration Alongside the Container Image – Keep your deployment settings with your container for better portability and consistency.
