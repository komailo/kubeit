This directory has examples of what an interface to our next generation CD workflows would look like.

The placement of these files is not set, but ideally this will be close to the source code.

If its a multi service archetecture where multiple artifacts combine to a single service, it can be placed in a dedicated repo of its own.

Service is the starting poing -> ServiceApps (multiple service apps can link up to a single service)
Service -> Promotion Every app in the service will be promoted
